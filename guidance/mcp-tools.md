# MCP Tool Selection

Rules for choosing between available MCP tool providers when multiple cover the same service.

## Google Services

**Default to Claude AI MCP** (`mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__*`, `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Calendar__*`, `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Drive__*`) for all Google operations.

**Use piotr-agier `google-drive` MCP** (`mcp__google-drive__*`) only when:
- Writing/creating/updating files on Google Drive
- Sheets formatting, Slides manipulation, or bulk operations not supported by Claude MCP

**Why:** Claude MCP is the primary interface. Piotr MCP has richer write capabilities for Drive/Sheets/Slides that Claude MCP lacks. Using both without a rule leads to inconsistent tool selection across sessions.

**Quick reference:**
| Operation | Provider |
|-----------|----------|
| Read Gmail, Calendar, Drive | Claude AI MCP |
| Search Gmail, Calendar, Drive | Claude AI MCP |
| Create/update Drive files | piotr google-drive MCP |
| Sheets formatting | piotr google-drive MCP |
| Slides creation | piotr google-drive MCP |
