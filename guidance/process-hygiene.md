# Process Hygiene

Track what you start. Clean up what you leave behind.

## Track What You Start

If you spawn a long-running process — `npm run dev`, a background build, a watch command, a test runner in watch mode — you own it for the duration of your session.

- **Record the PID or process name** when you start something. You'll need it to stop it later.
- **Stop it before session end** or document it in `context.md` so the next session knows it's running.
- **Don't assume PM2 will manage it.** Only processes in `ecosystem.config.cjs` (or equivalent) are managed. Anything you start with `node`, `npm run dev`, or `&` is orphaned when your session ends.

```bash
# Start a dev server — note the PID
npm run dev &
DEV_PID=$!
echo "Dev server running on PID $DEV_PID"

# Later, clean up
kill $DEV_PID
```

## Atomic State Writes

When updating `context.md` or `progress.md`, treat the update as its own operation — don't leave it as the last step in a chain that might not complete.

- **Update context files early and often**, not just at session end
- **Commit the context update with the work it describes**, in the same commit
- If you're about to do something risky (a build, a deploy, a large refactor), update `context.md` *before* the risky step so that if it crashes, the state is captured

## Temp File Cleanup

- Don't leave temp files in `/tmp`, project directories, or anywhere else
- If you create scratch files during debugging (`test.js`, `debug.log`, `temp.json`), delete them before committing
- If a process creates temp files (detached job output, build artifacts), clean them up or document their location

## Port and Process Conflicts

Before starting any server or service:

```bash
# Is the port already in use?
ss -tlnp | grep <port>

# Is a previous instance still running?
ps aux | grep <process-name>
pm2 list
```

Don't blindly start a service on a port that's occupied. Either stop the existing process (if it's yours) or use a different port. If the existing process belongs to another session, coordinate — don't kill it.

## Cleanup Checklist (Before Session End)

1. **Processes:** Stop any dev servers, watch commands, or background tasks you started
2. **Temp files:** Delete any scratch files you created
3. **Ports:** Verify you haven't left a rogue server bound to a port
4. **Git state:** No uncommitted changes related to your task
5. **Context:** `context.md` reflects what's running and what's not
