# Testing Guidance

Detailed testing standards that extend the core rules in `agent.md`.

## When to Test

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Bug fix | Write a regression test that fails without the fix, passes with it |
| New function with logic | Unit test covering happy path + edge cases |
| API endpoint | Integration test covering request/response cycle |
| Refactor | Ensure existing tests still pass; add tests if coverage was lacking |
| Config/copy-only change | No new tests needed |
| Repo has no test infra | Don't add one unless asked |

## Test File Placement

- Match the repo's existing pattern. Common conventions:
  - `__tests__/ComponentName.test.js` (React/Jest)
  - `tests/test_module.py` (Python/pytest)
  - `*.spec.ts` next to the source file (Vitest, Mocha)
- If no convention exists, co-locate tests next to source files.

## Test Structure

```javascript
describe('functionName', () => {
  it('returns expected result for valid input', () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = 'valid';

    // Act
    const result = functionName(input);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('expected');
  });

  it('throws on invalid input', () => {
    expect(() => functionName(null)).toThrow();
  });
});
```

## What to Test

- **Happy path:** Does the function work with typical input?
- **Edge cases:** Empty strings, zero, null/undefined, large numbers, special characters.
- **Error paths:** Does it fail gracefully with bad input?
- **Boundaries:** Off-by-one errors, array boundaries, date rollovers.

## What NOT to Test

- Implementation details (private methods, internal state).
- Third-party library behavior (trust that `lodash.get` works).
- Trivial getters/setters with no logic.
- UI layout pixel-by-pixel (use snapshot tests sparingly).

## Mocking Guidelines

- **Mock at boundaries:** HTTP clients, databases, file system, timers, `Date.now()`.
- **Don't mock the unit under test.** If you need to, the function is doing too much — refactor it.
- **Prefer dependency injection** over module-level mocking where possible.
- **Reset mocks between tests:** `beforeEach(() => jest.clearAllMocks())` or equivalent.

## Running Tests

```bash
# JavaScript/TypeScript
npm test                    # run full suite
npx jest --watch            # watch mode during development
npx jest path/to/test.js    # run a single test file
npx jest --coverage         # check coverage

# Python
pytest                      # run full suite
pytest tests/test_file.py   # single file
pytest -x                   # stop on first failure
pytest --cov=src            # check coverage
```

## Coverage

- Don't chase 100% coverage. Aim for meaningful coverage of business logic.
- Uncovered code is fine if it's glue code, config, or error handling that's hard to trigger in tests.
- If the repo has a coverage threshold configured, respect it.
