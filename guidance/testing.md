# Testing Guidance

Detailed testing standards that extend the core rules in `agent.md`.

## When to Test

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Bug fix | Write a regression test that fails without the fix, passes with it |
| New function with logic | Unit test covering happy path + edge cases |
| API endpoint | Integration test covering request/response cycle |
| Refactor | Ensure existing tests still pass; add tests if coverage was lacking |
| Config/copy-only change | No new tests needed |
| Repo has no test infra | Don't add one unless asked |

## Test File Placement

- Match the repo's existing pattern. Common conventions:
  - `__tests__/ComponentName.test.js` (React/Jest)
  - `tests/test_module.py` (Python/pytest)
  - `*.spec.ts` next to the source file (Vitest, Mocha)
- If no convention exists, co-locate tests next to source files.

## Test Structure

```javascript
describe('functionName', () => {
  it('returns expected result for valid input', () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = 'valid';

    // Act
    const result = functionName(input);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('expected');
  });

  it('throws on invalid input', () => {
    expect(() => functionName(null)).toThrow();
  });
});
```

## What to Test

- **Happy path:** Does the function work with typical input?
- **Edge cases:** Empty strings, zero, null/undefined, large numbers, special characters.
- **Error paths:** Does it fail gracefully with bad input?
- **Boundaries:** Off-by-one errors, array boundaries, date rollovers.

## What NOT to Test

- Implementation details (private methods, internal state).
- Third-party library behavior (trust that `lodash.get` works).
- Trivial getters/setters with no logic.
- UI layout pixel-by-pixel (use snapshot tests sparingly).

## Mocking Guidelines

- **Mock at boundaries:** HTTP clients, databases, file system, timers, `Date.now()`.
- **Don't mock the unit under test.** If you need to, the function is doing too much — refactor it.
- **Prefer dependency injection** over module-level mocking where possible.
- **Reset mocks between tests:** `beforeEach(() => jest.clearAllMocks())` or equivalent.

## Running Tests

```bash
# JavaScript/TypeScript
npm test                    # run full suite
npx jest --watch            # watch mode during development
npx jest path/to/test.js    # run a single test file
npx jest --coverage         # check coverage

# Python
pytest                      # run full suite
pytest tests/test_file.py   # single file
pytest -x                   # stop on first failure
pytest --cov=src            # check coverage
```

## Coverage

- Don't chase 100% coverage. Aim for meaningful coverage of business logic.
- Uncovered code is fine if it's glue code, config, or error handling that's hard to trigger in tests.
- If the repo has a coverage threshold configured, respect it.

## Testing Pyramid Strategy

When a project has recurring quality issues (code ships that doesn't actually work), apply this prioritized testing investment. Each layer reduces the number of incidents the next layer needs to catch.

| Priority | Layer | What It Catches | Cost |
|----------|-------|-----------------|------|
| 1 | Failure audit | Tells you where to invest | Hours |
| 2 | Contract tests | Mock drift, API shape mismatches | Low |
| 3 | Integration tests (real deps) | Backend logic, migrations, auth bugs | Medium |
| 4 | Post-deploy smoke tests | Config drift, bad deploys | Low |
| 5 | Authenticated browser tests | Auth flows, full-stack integration | High |

**Start at the top.** Do not skip to browser tests without completing the lower layers first.

### Layer 1: Failure Audit

Before writing any new tests, classify the last 5-10 production incidents. For each:
- What broke (auth, rendering, data, config, race condition)
- Whether a test existed for that path
- If a test existed and passed, *why* it passed when prod was broken (mock drift, shallow assertion, wrong environment config)
- When it was caught (pre-deploy, post-deploy, user report)

Use `templates/failure-audit.md` to structure this. The output tells you exactly which testing layer to invest in.

### Layer 2: Contract Tests

If incidents trace back to "test passed with mocks but prod behaved differently," your mocks encode stale assumptions. Fix this with:
- Schema checks against real API responses recorded from staging
- Snapshot the actual response shape from a real endpoint, then validate mocks match that shape
- Update snapshots as part of the deploy pipeline

**When to use:** Any service boundary where you currently use mocks -- external APIs, database queries, auth providers.

### Layer 3: Integration Tests with Real Dependencies

For backend logic failures (bad queries, broken migrations, auth provider interactions):
- Hit real databases, real auth providers, and real caches
- Control state setup explicitly -- each test owns its fixtures
- Run in CI, deterministic if you own the fixture lifecycle
- **Do not mock the database** -- mock/prod divergence is the #1 source of false-green tests

### Layer 4: Post-Deploy Smoke Tests

Lightweight, fast (under 30 seconds), non-browser checks against the deployed environment:
- Authenticate with a test account
- Hit the 3-5 most critical endpoints
- Assert HTTP 200 and basic response shape (not just status code)
- Run automatically after every staging deploy

This catches environment config drift and bad deploys immediately. It is deployment validation, not e2e testing.

### Layer 5: Authenticated Browser Tests (Use Sparingly)

Only proceed here if the failure audit shows incidents that ONLY a real browser would have caught (broken auth flows, CORS/CSP issues, token refresh failures).

**Constraints:**
- Maximum 5-8 scenarios. Start by reproducing a specific past incident, not writing speculative tests
- Dedicated test account with stable credentials, managed via secrets
- Run against staging only, never production
- Each test owns its state -- setup creates what it needs, teardown removes it
- Assert on intercepted API responses, not just DOM elements
- Capture screenshots, network logs, and console errors on failure

**Flakiness policy:** Quarantine on the second consecutive flake. Move to a non-blocking suite until fixed. A flaky test the team ignores is worse than no test.

**Tag every test** by the failure mode it guards against (`@auth-flow`, `@regression-INCIDENT-42`).

## Mock Fidelity

Mocks that diverge from production are worse than no mocks -- they give false confidence.

- **Record real responses** from staging/production as mock fixtures. Re-record periodically
- **Validate mock shape** against the real API schema on every CI run
- **Never hand-write mock data** for external APIs -- use recorded fixtures
- **If a mock test passes but the feature is broken in prod**, the mock is the bug -- fix the mock, not the test

## What NOT to Build

- Browser tests against production (test data leaks into real systems)
- More than 8-10 browser test scenarios (you're compensating for missing integration tests -- push coverage down the pyramid)
- Tests without a corresponding past incident (speculative tests have low ROI and high maintenance cost)
