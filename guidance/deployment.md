# Deployment

## Pre-Deploy Checklist

1. All changes committed and pushed via PR.
2. Build succeeds locally.
3. Tests pass.
4. `context.md` updated with deployment intent.
5. No secrets exposed in repository history.
6. Dependencies are locked (`package-lock.json` committed).
7. **If `package.json` or `package-lock.json` changed, run `npm install` on the target before restarting.** Missing this causes crash loops from missing modules.

## Post-Deploy Verification

"It built clean" is not "it works." Run these within 30 seconds of every deploy:

1. `pm2 show <process>` to confirm status is `online`, uptime is climbing, restart count hasn't spiked.
2. `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" <url>` to confirm HTTP 200 from the live URL.
3. `pm2 logs <process> --lines 20` to scan for errors, uncaught exceptions, or crash loops in the first 30 seconds.
4. If the app has authentication, verify the sign-in flow works end-to-end.
5. Update `context.md` with deployment status and any issues observed.
6. If any check fails, **do not move on**. Diagnose and fix before declaring the deploy complete.

Infer deploy commands from repo config (GitHub Actions, scripts, `context.md`).
