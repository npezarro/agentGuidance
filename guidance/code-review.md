# Code Review Guidance

Self-review checklist to run before every commit and PR.

## Pre-Commit Checklist

### 1. Correctness
- [ ] Does the change solve the stated problem?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled (empty input, null, zero, negative numbers)?
- [ ] Are error states handled at system boundaries?
- [ ] Does async code properly `await` and handle rejections?

### 2. No Regressions
- [ ] Build passes: `npm run build`
- [ ] Tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Existing functionality still works (manual spot-check if no tests)

### 3. Security
- [ ] No secrets, API keys, tokens, or passwords in the diff
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or URLs with auth info
- [ ] User input is validated/sanitized at entry points
- [ ] SQL/NoSQL queries use parameterized inputs (no string interpolation)
- [ ] No `eval()`, `innerHTML`, or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user data

### 4. Code Quality
- [ ] Variable and function names are descriptive and follow existing conventions
- [ ] No dead code, commented-out blocks, or debug `console.log` statements
- [ ] No duplicated logic that should be extracted
- [ ] Functions do one thing and are reasonably short
- [ ] Complex logic has a brief comment explaining *why*

### 5. File Hygiene
- [ ] No unintended files staged (`.DS_Store`, `node_modules/`, build output, `.env`)
- [ ] Lockfiles (`package-lock.json`) are updated if dependencies changed
- [ ] No unrelated changes mixed into the commit

### 6. Git Hygiene
- [ ] Commit message explains *why*, not just *what*
- [ ] Commit is on the correct branch (not `main`)
- [ ] `git diff --staged` reviewed line by line

## PR Review Checklist

When opening a PR, also verify:

### 7. PR Scope
- [ ] PR addresses a single concern (one feature, one bug, one refactor)
- [ ] PR title is clear and under 70 characters
- [ ] PR description explains what changed and why
- [ ] Reviewer can understand the change without prior context

### 8. Testing Evidence
- [ ] Describe how the change was tested
- [ ] Include test output or screenshots if applicable
- [ ] Note any areas that need manual testing

### 9. Deployment Impact
- [ ] Any environment variable changes documented
- [ ] Any migration or data changes noted
- [ ] Rollback plan identified for risky changes

## Protected Configuration (Do Not Remove)

Some configuration properties look like dead code but are essential for production. Never remove these during fix or cleanup runs without verifying the deployment context:

- **NextAuth/Auth.js**: `basePath`, `redirectProxyUrl`, provider `authorization.params`, `token.params` — required for subpath deployments behind reverse proxies. See `agentGuidance/guidance/auth-basepath.md`.
- **PM2 ecosystem.config.js**: `env`, `max_memory_restart`, `cwd` — essential for production process management.
- **Apache/proxy config references in code**: URL construction that includes basePaths or proxy prefixes.

**Why:** autonomousDev crash-fix run #134 removed `basePath` and `redirectProxyUrl` from finance-tracker's auth.ts because they appeared unused. This broke OAuth on the subpath deployment, requiring a manual restore (60db078).

## Common Issues to Watch For

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| `catch (e) {}` | Swallowed error | Log or rethrow |
| `array.length > 0 ? array[0] : undefined` | Verbose | `array[0]` (already undefined if empty) |
| `if (x == null)` | Loose equality | `if (x === null \|\| x === undefined)` or keep `== null` if intentional |
| `async` function with no `await` | Unnecessary async wrapper | Remove `async` keyword |
| `new Date()` in business logic | Untestable | Inject time as parameter |
| String concatenation for paths | OS-incompatible | Use `path.join()` |
| Prisma `globalForPrisma` dev-only cache | Connection leak in production | Cache on `globalThis` unconditionally (see below) |
| `new Date("2026-04-15")` for display | UTC parse → local timezone off-by-one | Use `new Date(year, month, day)` for local dates |

## Prisma globalThis Singleton — Always Cache in Production

The standard Next.js Prisma pattern only caches the client in development:

```ts
// ❌ Bug: production creates new clients on duplicate module loads
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
```

With adapters like `@prisma/adapter-libsql`, production can also load the module multiple times, leaking connections. Always cache unconditionally:

```ts
// ✅ Prevents connection leaks in both dev and production
globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
```

**Affected repos:** botlink, finance-tracker (still have the dev-only guard). health-hub fixed this in commit 8ed8356.
