# Browser Page Reader (page-reader)

## What It Is
A CLI utility that loads URLs in a headless Chromium browser with full JavaScript rendering and returns structured page content. Built on Playwright, but purpose-built for content extraction rather than browser automation.

## When to Use It
- **JS-heavy pages** that don't render with simple HTTP fetch (modern SPAs, React/Angular sites)
- **Page status checks** where you need to determine if a page is live, changed, or removed
- **Any page where WebFetch or Cheerio returns incomplete/broken content** because the page relies on client-side rendering
- **Getting full visible text** from a page for analysis

## CRITICAL: Use page-reader, NOT WebFetch, for Link Liveness Checks
**WebFetch cannot determine if a JS-rendered page is live or dead.** Many modern sites are SPAs that render via JavaScript. WebFetch returns raw HTML without executing JS, so every page looks "empty" — leading to false negatives. This has caused full-session wasted work.

**For bulk URL checks:** Use `curl + data-attribute parsing` as a fast first pass, then use page-reader for ambiguous results. **Always test your detection method on 1 known-live, 1 known-dead, and 1 fake URL before running a bulk check.**

**Never delegate link-checking to sub-agents using WebFetch** — they'll hit the same SPA rendering wall. Use page-reader or curl in the main thread.

## When NOT to Use It
- Static HTML pages where WebFetch works fine
- Pages you need to interact with (click, fill forms, navigate); use the Playwright MCP for those
- APIs that return JSON directly

## Where It Lives
- **Local (WSL):** `~/repos/page-reader/`
- **VM:** `~/page-reader/`

## Usage

```bash
# Full structured JSON output (title, meta, OG, text, links, signals)
node ~/repos/page-reader/src/index.js <url>

# Just the visible text, no JSON wrapper
node ~/repos/page-reader/src/index.js --text-only <url>

# Longer wait for slow SPAs (default 2000ms)
node ~/repos/page-reader/src/index.js --wait 5000 <url>

# With screenshot (base64 in output)
node ~/repos/page-reader/src/index.js --screenshot <url>

# Compact JSON (no pretty-print, good for piping)
node ~/repos/page-reader/src/index.js --compact <url>

# Custom timeout (default 30000ms)
node ~/repos/page-reader/src/index.js --timeout 60000 <url>
```

## Output Structure (JSON mode)
Key fields in the JSON output:
- `status`: "ok", "error", or "redirect"
- `title`: Page title
- `text`: Full visible text content (the main thing you want)
- `meta`, `ogData`: SEO metadata
- `jsonLd`: Structured data (JobPosting schema, etc.)
- `signals.jobClosed`: Boolean, true if closed-job patterns detected
- `signals.closedReason`: The matched text that triggered closed detection
- `signals.requires`: Array of blockers like "login" or "captcha"
- `timing`: Load and total time in ms

## Signal Detection
Automatically detects:
- **Closed/expired jobs**: "no longer accepting", "position filled", "this job is closed", "job not found", "couldn't find that page", expired JSON-LD dates
- **Login walls**: Password fields + "sign in to continue" patterns
- **Captchas**: reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha iframes
- **Cloudflare challenges**: Detects `cf-mitigated:challenge` header and 403 responses, waits up to 12s for auto-resolution before extracting content. Enables reading pages behind Cloudflare bot protection (e.g., OpenAI careers).
- **Redirects**: When the final URL differs from the requested URL

## Stealth Mode
Use `--stealth` for sites with bot detection:
```bash
node ~/repos/page-reader/src/index.js --stealth --wait 5000 <url>
```
- Randomizes viewport dimensions slightly
- Sets `navigator.webdriver` to false
- Uses `domcontentloaded` instead of `networkidle` (avoids hanging on blocked trackers)
- Sets US locale and timezone

## Calling from Docker Containers

The standard CLI (`node ~/repos/page-reader/src/index.js`) is not accessible inside a Docker container. Use the `page-reader-proxy` PM2 service instead.

**What it is:** An HTTP server (`src/server.js`) running from `~/repos/page-reader`, exposed on port 3092. PM2 process name: `page-reader-proxy`.

**How to call it from a Docker container:**

1. Add `host.docker.internal:host-gateway` to `extra_hosts` in `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   extra_hosts:
     - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
   ```

2. Call it via HTTP from inside the container:
   ```
   http://host.docker.internal:3092/fetch?url=ENCODED_URL&stealth=true
   ```
   URL-encode the target URL. Use `stealth=true` for bot-protected pages.

**Pattern:** Use as a fallback in Docker-bridged Claude CLI system prompts when the direct URL returns a 500, 403, empty body, or bot-block response. Call it via `Bash(curl:*)`, NOT WebFetch.

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT instruct Docker-containerized Claude CLI to retry via `WebFetch http://host.docker.internal:3092/...`. WebFetch routes through Anthropic's edge fetcher — it cannot reach `host.docker.internal` or any RFC1918/localhost address. The fallback silently returns empty/wrong content with no error signal. Always use `Bash: curl` for docker-internal URLs.

```bash
# WRONG — WebFetch goes to Anthropic's edge, never reaches your local proxy
# (WebFetch) http://host.docker.internal:3092/fetch?url=...

# CORRECT — Bash(curl) runs in-process and reaches the Docker network
curl "http://host.docker.internal:3092/fetch?url=ENCODED_URL&stealth=true"
```

Note: `curl` must be installed in the container image (not present in slim/alpine images by default — add to Dockerfile with `apt-get install -y curl` or `apk add curl`).

Source: shopper `docker/CLAUDE.md` (2026-05-24, original pattern); corrected 2026-06-03 after Amazon-blocked queries shipped `[UNVERIFIED]` prices for weeks due to the silent WebFetch failure. See also `process-hygiene.md` § "WebFetch Routes Through Anthropic's Edge".
